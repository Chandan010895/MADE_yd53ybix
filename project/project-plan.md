Project Plan: Jail Deaths Dataset Analysis
Title:
Jail Deaths in the U.S.: An Analysis of Trends and Causes

Main Question:
What are the trends and contributing factors to jail deaths across different U.S. states?

Description:
This project will analyze a dataset of jail deaths in the U.S., focusing on trends related to cause of death, demographics, and state-level differences. The goal is to identify patterns, understand potential systemic issues, and provide insights into the effectiveness of jail health care and the conditions within U.S. jails.

Datasources:
Datasource: Jail Deaths Dataset (ZIP file with Excel)
URL: Jail Deaths Dataset
Description: Data on in-custody deaths across U.S. jails, including cause, date, state, and other demographics.
Work Packages:
Data Collection:

Objective: Download, extract, and load the dataset.
Deliverable: Loaded data into a pandas DataFrame.
Data Cleaning:

Objective: Clean missing values, remove duplicates, and ensure correct data types.
Deliverable: A cleaned and processed DataFrame.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Objective: Identify key trends, such as death rates over time and state-level differences.
Deliverable: EDA results with visualizations.
Data Storage:

Objective: Store cleaned data in both SQLite and CSV formats for future analysis.
Deliverable: SQLite database and CSV file.
