# Project Plan: Population Analysis in The Americas

## Title
Population Dynamics in North and South America

## Main Question
How do population trends differ across North and South America, and what are the factors influencing these trends?

## Description
This project will analyze the population dynamics of North and South America, focusing on trends such as growth rates, migration, urbanization, and demographics. Using statistical methods and geographic analysis, this project aims to identify key factors influencing population changes in both continents. Insights gained will contribute to understanding regional challenges, such as resource allocation, infrastructure development, and social policies.

## Datasources
- **Datasource1**: World Bank Population Data  
  - **Metadata URL**: [World Bank Population Data](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL)  
  - **Data URL**: [CSV Format](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?view=chart)  
  - **Data Type**: CSV  
  - **Description**: Annual population data for countries in North and South America.

## Work Packages
- **Work Package #1**: Data Collection and Cleaning  
  - Gather population data from World Bank and other reliable sources.  
  - Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values and outliers.  

- **Work Package #2**: Trend Analysis  
  - Perform time series analysis to identify population growth rates and trends over the past decades.

- **Work Package #3**: Regional Comparison  
  - Compare population trends between North and South America.  
  - Investigate the role of migration, fertility rates, and mortality rates in population changes.

- **Work Package #4**: Report and Recommendations  
  - Analyze results and provide insights on policy implications.  
  - Present findings in a final report with recommendations for addressing population-related challenges.

This project will be refined as new data and insights are collected throughout the semester.
